Push code to GITHUB
-------------------

1. Open github url --> https://github.com/
2. Create a profile
3. Create a public repository with optional README.md file
4. Copy the SSH url(by clicking on Clone or Download green button), ex: git@github.com:thiruvanagiri84/testrepo.git
5. Go to Profile Settings(Top right side corner) 
6. Click on SSH and GPG Keys
7. Click Generate Key
8. Open Git Bash
9. Type in:  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	replace with the email id used for creating Github profile
10. It will ask for the path to store the rsa public key --> Press ENTER if you dont want to change the shown path
11. Again press ENTER twice if asked for paraphrase OR enter some paraphrase
12. Now the SSH key gets generated under C:/Users/Username/.ssh folder. Copy the SSH key from id_rsa.pub file
13. Paste this SSH key in the SSH and GPG keys page --> Click add (These keys might expire frequently, so keep adding by following this procedure)
14. Go to Git bash
15. Go to the folder you want to push to Github (Ex: C:\Users\THIRUVANAGIRI\Downloads\GitTest
													 Change it like this 
													 /C/Users/THIRUVANAGIRI/Downloads/GitTest)
16. Type: git init 
17. Type: git remote add origin git@github.com:thiruvanagiri84/testrepo.git
	Replace with whatever repo you are using (and this should be SSH url, if you have created SSH key)
18. Type: git remote -v
	This will verify 
19. Type: git gui
	This will open GUI window where we can see all the files of the folder which we are currently in
20. Select the file from left side bar and Select Commit from drop down and Click Stage to Commit
21. That file will come to bottom left bar and you can write some commit comments and then click Commit.
22. Here if Identity error comes then,
	Type these 2 commands in Git bash
	git config --global user.email "santosh.thiruvanagiri@gmail.com"
	git config --global user.name "thiruvanagiri84" (thiruvanagiri84 is my username in github)
23. Then Click Push --> If everything is fine, then green Success message will be shown.
24. There might be error while pushing, if the repo already has a new checkin done by someone. Then go to Git bash and Type: git pull (getting latest version)
